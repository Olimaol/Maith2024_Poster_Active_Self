	abstract = {Many modern neural simulators focus on the simulation of networks of spiking neurons on parallel hardware. Another important framework in computational neuroscience, rate-coded neural networks, is mostly difficult or impossible to implement using these simulators. We present here the ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) neural simulator, which allows to easily define and simulate rate-coded and spiking networks, as well as combinations of both. The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the PyNN interface, while the definition of neuron and synapse models can be specified using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efficiently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efficient C++ code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

The rILN differ from both thalamic relay nuclei, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus, and caudal intralaminar nuclei, such as the parafascicular nucleus, in afferent and efferent connectivity as well as physiological and synaptic properties. rILN activity is associated with a range of neural functions and behaviors, including arousal, pain, executive function, and action control. Here, we review this evidence supporting a role for the rILN in integrating arousal, executive and motor feedback information. In light of rILN projections out to the striatum, amygdala, and sensory as well as executive cortices, we propose that such a function enables the rILN to modulate cognitive and motor resources to meet task-dependent behavioral engagement demands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The thalamostriatal projection is highly heterogeneous originating in many subnuclei of the thalamus including the midline (ML) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. We examined the dendritic morphology and axonal trajectory of 15 ML and 11 IL neurons by single-neuron labeling with viral vectors in combination with mu-opioid receptor immunostaining in rat brains. Dendritic and axonal morphology defined ML neurons as type II cells consisting of at least two subclasses according to the presence or absence of striatal axon collaterals. In the striatum, ML neurons preferentially innervated striosomes, whereas parafascicular neurons preferentially innervated the matrix. Almost all single thalamostriatal neurons favoring striosome or matrix compartments also innervated the cerebral cortical areas that supplied cortical input to the same striatal compartment. We thus revealed that thalamostriatal projections are highly organized 1) by the similarity in morphological characteristics and 2) their preference for the striatal compartments and cortical areas. These findings demonstrate that the functional properties of striatal compartments are influenced by both their cortical and thalamic afferents presumably with a different time latency and support selective dynamics for the striosome and matrix compartments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Because of our limited knowledge of the functional role of the thalamostriatal system, this massive network is often ignored in models of the pathophysiology of brain disorders of basal ganglia origin, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, over the past decade, significant advances have led to a deeper understanding of the anatomical, electrophysiological, behavioral and pathological aspects of the thalamostriatal system. The cloning of the vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (vGluT1 and vGluT2) has provided powerful tools to differentiate thalamostriatal from corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals, allowing us to carry out comparative studies of the synaptology and plasticity of these two systems in normal and pathological conditions. Findings from these studies have led to the recognition of two thalamostriatal systems, based on their differential origin from the caudal intralaminar nuclear group, the center median/parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex, or other thalamic nuclei. The recent use of optogenetic methods supports this model of the organization of the thalamostriatal systems, showing differences in functionality and glutamate receptor localization at thalamostriatal synapses from Pf and other thalamic nuclei. At the functional level, evidence largely gathered from thalamic recordings in awake monkeys strongly suggests that the thalamostriatal system from the CM/Pf is involved in regulating alertness and switching behaviors. Importantly, there is evidence that the caudal intralaminar nuclei and their axonal projections to the striatum partly degenerate in PD and that CM/Pf deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be therapeutically useful in several movement disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Both striatofugal neurons targeting the ipsilateral SNr (direct pathway) as well as striatal efferent neurons projecting to the ipsilateral GP (indirect pathway) were located within the terminal fields of the thalamostriatal afferents. In the subthalamic nucleus (STN), both neurons projecting to ipsilateral GP as well as neurons projecting to ipsilateral SNr also appear to receive thalamic afferents. Although the projections linking the caudal intralaminar nuclei with the ipsilateral striatum and STN are far more prominent, we also noticed that thalamic axons could gain access to the contralateral STN. Furthermore, a small number of STN neurons were seen to project to both the contralateral GP and PF nuclei.

A major source of glutamate driving striatal activity is the rostral intralaminar nuclei (rILN) of the thalamus. Yet, the information that is relayed to the striatum to support action selection is unknown. Here, we discovered that rILN neurons projecting to the DS are innervated by a range of cortical and subcortical afferents and that rILN→DS neurons stably signaled at two time points in mice performing an action sequence task reinforced by sucrose reward: action initiation and reward acquisition. In vivo activation of this pathway increased the number of successful trials, whereas inhibition decreased the number of successful trials.

The aims of this study was to investigate several questions on these projections, using modern neurotracing techniques in rats, to advance our understanding of the role of STN and ZI. We examined whether projection patterns to the subthlamus can be used to identify homologues of the primate centromedian (CM) and the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) in the rodent, the topography of the projection including what percent of intralaminar neurons participate in the projections, and electron microscopic examination of intralaminar synaptic boutons in STN. The aim on the SC-subthalamic projection was to examine whether STN is the main target of the projection. This study revealed: (i) the areas similar to primate CM and Pf could be recognized in the rat; (ii) the Pf-like area sends a very heavy topographically organized projection to STN but very sparse projection to ZI, which suggested that Pf might control basal ganglia function through STN; (iii) the projection from the CM-like area to the subthalamus was very sparse; (iv) Pf boutons and randomly sampled asymmetrical synapses had similar distributions on the dendrites of STN neurons; and (v) the lateral part of the deep layers of SC sends a very heavy projection to ZI and moderate to sparse projection to limited parts of STN, suggesting that SC is involved in a limited control of basal ganglia function.},

Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.},

However, the functional roles of this complex remain to be fully elucidated. Here we have examined whether the CM-Pf complex is involved in the process of covert attention. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a task in which a visual target stimulus for button release appeared at either the same location as the preceding visual instruction cue (a “validly cued target”) or a location on the opposite side (an “invalidly cued target”). Reaction times (RTs) to a validly cued target were significantly shorter than those to an invalidly cued target, leading to a “validity effect” of about 20 ms. We recorded the activity of 97 neurons in the CM-Pf while the monkeys performed the attention task with the hand that was contralateral to the neuronal recording. Seventy CM-Pf neurons showed task-related activity after the appearance of either the instruction cue or the target stimulus: 33 neurons responded with a prominent short-latency facilitation (SLF), whereas 37 responded with a short-latency suppression followed by a long-latency facilitation (LLF). Most of the SLF neurons responded preferentially to a cue appearing on the contralateral side (76\%) and to an invalidly cued target appearing on the contralateral side (61\%). In contrast, LLF neurons showed a short-latency suppression after the cue stimulus, regardless of whether the cue appeared on the contra- or ipsilateral side (84\%). Inactivating the CM-Pf complex by local injection (1 μl) of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (1–5 μg/μl) resulted in a significant increase in the RT to a validly cued target presented on the contra- but not the ipsilateral side. In contrast, inactivating the CM-Pf complex did not affect RTs to invalidly cued targets on either the contra- or the ipsilateral side. Thus the validity effect was abolished only on the contralateral side. We conclude that the CM-Pf complex plays a specific and essential role in the process of attentional orienting to external events occurring on the contralateral side, probably through the projection of primary outputs to the striatum, which is involved in the action-selection mechanisms of the basal ganglia.},

In rats, the DLS receives it densest inputs from primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, but it also receives substantial input from the thalamus. Much of rat DLS is devoted to processing whisker-related information, and thalamic projections to these whisker-responsive DLS regions originate from the parafascicular (Pf) and medial posterior (POm) nuclei. To determine which thalamic nucleus is better suited for mediating S-R associations in the DLS, we compared their input-output connections and neuronal responses to repetitive whisker stimulation. Tracing experiments demonstrate that POm projects specifically to the DLS, but the Pf innervates both dorsolateral and dorsomedial parts of the striatum. The Pf nucleus is innervated by whisker-sensitive sites in the superior colliculus, and these sites also send dense projections to the zona incerta, a thalamic region that sends inhibitory projections to the POm. These data suggest that projections from POm to the DLS are suppressed by incertal inputs when the superior colliculus is activated by unexpected sensory stimuli. Simultaneous recordings with two electrodes indicate that POm neurons are more responsive and habituate significantly less than Pf neurons during repetitive whisker stimulation. Response latencies are also shorter in POm than in Pf, which is consistent with the fact that Pf receives its whisker information via synaptic relays in the superior colliculus. These findings indicate that, compared with the Pf nucleus, POm transmits somatosensory information to the DLS with a higher degree of sensory fidelity.},
